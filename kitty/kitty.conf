copy_on_select yes

#: Copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. With this set to
#: clipboard, selecting text with the mouse will cause the text to be
#: copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms such as macOS that do not
#: have the concept of primary selection. You can instead specify a
#: name such as a1 to copy to a private kitty buffer. Map a shortcut
#: with the paste_from_buffer action to paste from this private
#: buffer. For example::

#:     copy_on_select a1
#:     map shift+cmd+v paste_from_buffer a1

# window_padding_width 0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.


hide_window_decorations yes

confirm_os_window_close 0 

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.


tab_bar_edge top

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.

# tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts).

tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 4.0

#: The margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the OS Window and the tab bar.
#: The second number is the margin between the tab bar and the
#: contents of the current tab.


#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color. (See also tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file.
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator. (See also
#:     tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators.
#:     (See also tab_powerline_style)
#: custom
#:     A user-supplied Python function called draw_tab is loaded from the file
#:     tab_bar.py in the kitty config directory. For examples of how to
#:     write such a function, see the functions named draw_tab_with_* in
#:     kitty's source code: kitty/tab_bar.py. See also
#:     this discussion <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/discussions/4447>
#:     for examples from kitty users.
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of tabs and
#:     allows for easy switching to a tab.

# tab_bar_align left

#: The horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: left,
#: center, right.

tab_bar_min_tabs 1

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown.

# tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

# tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

# tab_separator " â”‡"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

# tab_powerline_style angled

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

# tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

tab_title_template "{index}: {fmt.fg.red}{bell_symbol}{activity_symbol}{fmt.fg.tab}{title}"


#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. If you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab N. If you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. All data
#: available is:

#: title
#:     The current tab title.
#: index
#:     The tab index useable with goto_tab N goto_tab shortcuts.
#: layout_name
#:     The current layout name.
#: num_windows
#:     The number of windows in the tab.
#: num_window_groups
#:     The number of window groups (not counting overlay windows) in the tab.
#: tab.active_wd
#:     The working directory of the currently active window in the tab (expensive,
#:     requires syscall).
#: max_title_length
#:     The maximum title length available.

#: Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: Note that for backward compatibility, if {bell_symbol} or
#: {activity_symbol} are not present in the template, they are
#: prepended to it.

# active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs. If not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

# background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. This option applies only
#: if background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported
#: or background_image is set.

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).




# clipboard_max_size 64

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.


# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.


#: value of 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-
#: pixel antialiasing at common font sizes.

# macos_traditional_fullscreen no

#: Use the macOS traditional full-screen transition, that is faster,
#: but less pretty.

# macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Control where the window title is displayed on macOS. A value of
#: window will show the title of the currently active window at the
#: top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the title of
#: the currently active window in the macOS global menu bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. A value of all will show the title
#: in both places, and none hides the title. See
#: macos_menubar_title_max_length for how to control the length of the
#: title in the menu bar.

# macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of characters from the window title to show in
#: the macOS global menu bar. Values less than one means that there is
#: no maximum limit.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Use a custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see on both
#: light and dark backgrounds. Nowadays, the default macOS cursor
#: already comes with a white border. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this option
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_colorspace srgb

#: The colorspace in which to interpret terminal colors. The default
#: of srgb will cause colors to match those seen in web browsers. The
#: value of default will use whatever the native colorspace of the
#: display is. The value of displayp3 will use Apple's special
#: snowflake display P3 color space, which will result in over
#: saturated (brighter) colors with some color shift. Reloading
#: configuration will change this value only for newly created OS
#: windows.

# linux_display_server auto


#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, âŒƒ), shift (â‡§), alt
#: (opt, option, âŒ¥), super (cmd, command, âŒ˜). See also: GLFW mods
#: <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-input option,
#: kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that text
#: look for native_code, the value of that becomes the key name in the
#: shortcut. For example:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     on_key_input: glfw key: 0x61 native_code: 0x61 action: PRESS mods: none text: 'a'

#: Here, the key name for the A key is 0x61 and you can use it with::

#:     map ctrl+0x61 something

#: to map Ctrl+A to something.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

#: If you would like kitty to completely ignore a key event, not even
#: sending it to the program running in the terminal, map it to
#: discard_event::

#:     map kitty_mod+f1 discard_event

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut with combine action, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: This will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout.

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts with the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

# kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: Special modifier key alias for default shortcuts. You can change
#: the value of this option to alter all default shortcuts that use
#: kitty_mod.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: Remove all shortcut definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# action_alias

#: E.g. action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

#: Define action aliases to avoid repeating the same options in
#: multiple mappings. Aliases can be defined for any action and will
#: be expanded recursively. For example, the above alias allows you to
#: create mappings to launch a new tab in the current working
#: directory without duplication::

#:     map f1 launch_tab vim
#:     map f2 launch_tab emacs

#: Similarly, to alias kitten invocation::

#:     action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

# kitten_alias

#: E.g. kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: Like action_alias above, but specifically for kittens. Generally,
#: prefer to use action_alias. This option is a legacy version,
#: present for backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of
#: the aliased kitten to be substituted. So the example above will
#: cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the --hints-
#: offset=0 option applied.


#: Copy to clipboard

# map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard
map cmd+c       copy_to_clipboard

#::  There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#::  mapped to Ctrl+C. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#::  send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly,
#::  copy_and_clear_or_interrupt will copy and clear the selection or
#::  send an interrupt if there is no selection.

#: Paste from clipboard

# map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
map cmd+v       paste_from_clipboard

#: Paste from selection

# map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
# map shift+insert paste_from_selection

#: Pass selection to program

# map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#::  You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#::  program with pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#::  open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#::  will be passed as a command line argument to the program. For
#::  example::

#::      map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#::  You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running
#::  in a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#::      map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: Scroll to previous shell prompt

# map kitty_mod+z scroll_to_prompt -1

#::  Use a parameter of 0 for scroll_to_prompt to scroll to the last
#::  jumped to or the last clicked position. Requires shell
#::  integration <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/>
#::  to work.

#: Scroll to next shell prompt

# map kitty_mod+x scroll_to_prompt 1

#: Browse scrollback buffer in pager

# map kitty_mod+h show_scrollback

#::  You can pipe the contents of the current screen and history
#::  buffer as STDIN to an arbitrary program using launch --stdin-
#::  source. For example, the following opens the scrollback buffer in
#::  less in an overlay window::

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@screen_scrollback --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#::  For more details on piping screen and buffer contents to external
#::  programs, see launch <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/>.

#: Browse output of the last shell command in pager

# map kitty_mod+g show_last_command_output

#::  You can also define additional shortcuts to get the command
#::  output. For example, to get the first command output on screen::

#::      map f1 show_first_command_output_on_screen

#::  To get the command output that was last accessed by a keyboard
#::  action or mouse action::

#::      map f1 show_last_visited_command_output

#::  You can pipe the output of the last command run in the shell
#::  using the launch action. For example, the following opens the
#::  output in less in an overlay window::

#::      map f1 launch --stdin-source=@last_cmd_output --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#::  To get the output of the first command on the screen, use
#::  @first_cmd_output_on_screen. To get the output of the last jumped
#::  to command, use @last_visited_cmd_output.

#::  Requires shell integration
#::  <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> to work.

#: Useful to temporarily "zoom" the active window by switching to the
#: stack layout::

#:     map ctrl+alt+z toggle_layout stack

#: You can change the font size for all top-level kitty OS windows at
#: a time or only the current one.

#: To setup shortcuts to change only the current OS window's font
#: size::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size current 10.0

#: Use the hints kitten to select text and either pass it to an
#: external program or insert it into the terminal or copy it to the
#: clipboard.

#: Open URL

# map kitty_mod+e open_url_with_hints

#::  Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used
#::  to open the URL is specified in open_url_with.

#: Insert selected path

# map kitty_mod+p>f kitten hints --type path --program -

#::  Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful,
#::  for instance to run git commands on a filename output from a
#::  previous git command.

#: Open selected path

# map kitty_mod+p>shift+f kitten hints --type path

#::  Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

#: Insert selected line

# map kitty_mod+p>l kitten hints --type line --program -

#::  Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Useful for
#::  the output of things like: `ls -1`.

#: Insert selected word

# map kitty_mod+p>w kitten hints --type word --program -

#::  Select words and insert into terminal.

#: Insert selected hash

# map kitty_mod+p>h kitten hints --type hash --program -

#::  Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the
#::  terminal. Useful with git, which uses SHA1 hashes to identify
#::  commits.

#: Open the selected file at the selected line

# map kitty_mod+p>n kitten hints --type linenum

#::  Select something that looks like filename:linenum and open it in
#::  vim at the specified line number.

#: Open the selected hyperlink

# map kitty_mod+p>y kitten hints --type hyperlink

#::  Select a hyperlink (i.e. a URL that has been marked as such by
#::  the terminal program, for example, by `ls --hyperlink=auto`).


#: The hints kitten has many more modes of operation that you can map
#: to different shortcuts. For a full description see hints kitten
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/>.

#: Edit config file

# map kitty_mod+f2 edit_config_file
# map cmd+,        edit_config_file

#: Open the kitty command shell

# map kitty_mod+escape kitty_shell window

#::  Open the kitty shell in a new window / tab / overlay / os_window
#::  to control kitty using commands.

#: Increase background opacity

# map kitty_mod+a>m set_background_opacity +0.1

#: Decrease background opacity

# map kitty_mod+a>l set_background_opacity -0.1

#: Make background fully opaque

# map kitty_mod+a>1 set_background_opacity 1

#: Reset background opacity

# map kitty_mod+a>d set_background_opacity default

#: Reset the terminal

# map kitty_mod+delete clear_terminal reset active
# map opt+cmd+r        clear_terminal reset active

#::  You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For
#::  example::

#::      # Reset the terminal
#::      map f1 clear_terminal reset active
#::      # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
#::      map f1 clear_terminal clear active
#::      # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
#::      map f1 clear_terminal scrollback active
#::      # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#::      map f1 clear_terminal scroll active
#::      # Clear everything up to the line with the cursor
#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor active

#::  If you want to operate on all kitty windows instead of just the
#::  current one, use all instead of active.

#::  It is also possible to remap Ctrl+L to both scroll the current
#::  screen contents into the scrollback buffer and clear the screen,
#::  instead of just clearing the screen, for example, for ZSH add the
#::  following to ~/.zshrc:

#::  .. code-block:: zsh

#::      scroll-and-clear-screen() {
#::          printf '\n%.0s' {1..$LINES}
#::          zle clear-screen
#::      }
#::      zle -N scroll-and-clear-screen
#::      bindkey '^l' scroll-and-clear-screen

#: Clear up to cursor line

# map cmd+k clear_terminal to_cursor active

#: Reload kitty.conf

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file
# map ctrl+cmd+,   load_config_file

#::  Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it
#::  was loaded. Note that a handful of options cannot be dynamically
#::  changed and require a full restart of kitty. Particularly, when
#::  changing shortcuts for actions located on the macOS global menu
#::  bar, a full restart is needed. You can also map a keybinding to
#::  load a different config file, for example::

#::      map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#::  Note that all options from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#::  in other words the new configuration *replace* the old ones.

#: Debug kitty configuration

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config
# map opt+cmd+,    debug_config

#::  Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running
#::  with and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.

#: Send arbitrary text on key presses

#::  E.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all Hello World

#::  You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#::  client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For
#::  example::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#::  This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+A key
#::  combination. The text to be sent is a python string literal so
#::  you can use escapes like \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to
#::  send Unicode characters (or you can just input the Unicode
#::  characters directly as UTF-8 text). You can use `kitty +kitten
#::  show_key` to get the key escape codes you want to emulate.

#::  The first argument to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to
#::  activate the shortcut. The possible values are normal,
#::  application, kitty or a comma separated combination of them. The
#::  modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#::  for terminals, and kitty refers to the kitty extended keyboard
#::  protocol. The special value all means all of them.

#::  Some more examples::

#::      # Output a word and move the cursor to the start of the line (like typing and pressing Home)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
#::      # Run a command at a shell prompt (like typing the command and pressing Enter)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal,application some command with arguments\r
